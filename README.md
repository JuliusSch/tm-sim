# tm-sim
 Program simulating a version of a Turing machine running various machines on various inputs, detailing all steps along the way.
 The program supports editing the tape, pausing and starting the machine, tracking which instruction is currently being executed and variable running speeds for quick calculation or slow analysis of the steps. Additionally, for those who want to write their own Turing machine for the program to run, this can be done by adding a folder with the name of the machine and adding text files for alphabet, initial tape, states and instructions in the same manner as the included programs.
